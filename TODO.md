# TODO
  * Enable SSL on CDM consumer:
    * Look at https://git.tc.bbn.com/bbn/ta3-api-bindings-python/blob/master/examples/consume_file.py
  * Cache database lookups in Anomaly Detection code (so you don't have to query the database all of the time)
  * Finish automating installation of everything via `apt install analysis-db-tools`
